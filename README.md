# Memory-Management-System
Console based Memory Management System coded in C++
Basic conpcept of Memory Management using liked lists

This project is an implementation of a memory management system using a singly linked list data structure in C++. The memory management system allows allocating and deallocating memory blocks to programs based on different strategies: best fit and first fit.

The memory management system supports two strategies: best fit and first fit. Best fit strategy allocates the smallest available block that can accommodate the program, while first fit strategy allocates the first available block that meets the program's size requirement.

Overall, the code provides a basic implementation of a memory management system using linked lists and allows the user to interact with it through a menu-driven interface.
